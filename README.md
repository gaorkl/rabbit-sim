# Rabbit-SIM

Rabbit-SIM uses arcade and glsl to calculate first-person-view from a top-down image of a game written in Pymunk/Arcade.

It is intended as a prototype for a new version of Simple PLaygrounds:
- entity that are created from sprites.
- ray sensors that are calculated using GLSL on GPU.
